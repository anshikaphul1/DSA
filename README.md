🌱 Growth Mindset
“The only way to learn to code... is to code.”

I'm not rushing. I'm not perfect. I’m just improving one problem at a time.


# 🧠 Daily DSA Practice

Welcome to my **Daily DSA Practice Repository**!

Every day, I solve at least one DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) problem from LeetCode. 
I don’t follow a strict roadmap — I pick problems that I find approachable or intriguing on that day.

## ✨ Why This Repo?

- To build consistency in problem-solving.
- To strengthen logical thinking and coding fundamentals.
- To track my daily progress publicly.
- To stay accountable and motivated.

✅ My DSA Routine
👨‍💻 1+ problem daily, sometimes more if time allows.

🚀 No fixed topic order — I solve based on interest and difficulty level I’m comfortable with.

🧠 Focus is on understanding logic deeply, not just solving.
